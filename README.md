<h3>Office 365 Extractor</h3>
This script makes it possible to extract log data out of an Office365 environment. The script created by us consist out of four main options, which enable the investigator to easily extract logging out of an Office365 environment. 

1.	Show available log sources and amount of logging
2.	Extract all audit logging
3.	Extract group audit logging
4.	Extract Specific audit logging (advanced mode)

<h3>Show available log sources and amount of logging</h3>
Pretty straightforward a search is executed and the total number of logs within the<br>
set timeframe will be displayed and written to a csv file called "Amount_Of_Audit_Logs.csv" the file is prefixed with a random number to prevent duplicates.

<h3>Extract all audit logs</h3>
Extract all audit logs" this option wil get all available audit logs within the set timeframe and written out to a file called AuditRecords.CSV.

<h3>Extract group logging</h3>
Extract a group of logs. You can for example extract all Exchange or Azure logging in one go<br>

<h3>Extract specific audit logs</h3>
Extract specific audit logs" Use this option if you want to extract a subset of the audit logs. To configure what logs will be extracted the tool needs to<br>
be configured with the required Record Types. A full list of recordtypes can be found at the bottom of this page.<br>
The output files will be writen in a directory called 'Log_Directory" and will be given the name of their recordtype e.g. (ExchangeItem_AuditRecords.csv) <br>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	-PowerShell<br>
	-Office365 account with privileges to access/extract audit logging<br>
	-One of the following windows versions:<br> 
Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, or Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1)<br>
Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1<br>
<br>

You have to be assigned the View-Only Audit Logs or Audit Logs role in Exchange Online to search the Office 365 audit log.
By default, these roles are assigned to the Compliance Management and Organization Management role groups on the Permissions page in the Exchange admin center. To give a user the ability to search the Office 365 audit log with the minimum level of privileges, you can create a custom role group in Exchange Online, add the View-Only Audit Logs or Audit Logs role, and then add the user as a member of the new role group. For more information, see Manage role groups in Exchange Online.

<h3>Known errors</h3>
<b>Import-PSSession : No command proxies have been created, because all of the requested remote....</b><br>
This error is caused when the script did not close correctly and an active session will be running in the background.
The script tries to import/load all modules again, but this is not necessary since it is already loaded. This error message has no impact on the script and will be gone when the open session gets closed. This can be done by restarting the PowerShell Windows or entering the following command: Get-PSSession | Remove-PSSession <br>

<b>Audit logging is enabled in the Office 365 environment but no logs are getting displayed?</b><br>
The user must be assigned an Office 365 E5 license. Alternatively, users with an Office 365 E1 or E3 license can be assigned an Advanced eDiscovery standalone license. Administrators and compliance officers who are assigned to cases and use Advanced eDiscovery to analyze data don't need an E5 license.<br>

<b>Audit log search argument start date should be after</b><br>
The start date should be earlier then the end date.

<b>New-PSSession: [outlook.office365.com] Connecting to remove server outlook.office365.com failed with the following error message: Access is denied.</b><br>
The password/username combination are incorrect or the user has not enough privileges to extract the audit logging.<br>
